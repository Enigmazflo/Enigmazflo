  <summary>My Journey</summary>
  I grew up in Mumbai, India, where my fascination with computers began. After completing my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Mumbai, I worked as a full-stack developer in Mumbai. I learned a lot during this time, tackling various projects and honing my skills in software development.

But I wanted to learn more, to challenge myself further. So, I decided to pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science in the United States. It was a big step for me, leaving behind the familiar streets of Mumbai for the unknown in the USA. But I was excited for the opportunity to learn from some of the best minds in the field.

Studying in the USA has been a rewarding experience. I've had the chance to delve deeper into computer science, exploring new ideas and concepts that I hadn't encountered before. But one thing that really caught my attention was the world of open source.

Back in India, I had heard about open source but didn't fully understand its significance. However, as I immersed myself in the tech community in the USA, I began to realize the power of open source. The idea of collaborating with developers from around the world to build something together was truly inspiring.

As I learned more about open source, my interest in it grew. I started contributing to various projects, eager to be part of this global community of developers. It was a bit intimidating at first, but with time, I became more confident in my abilities.

Today, I'm still on my journey in the world of open source. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities for learning. And I'm grateful for the chance to be part of such an incredible community, where knowledge is freely shared, and collaboration knows no bounds.
